A random assortment of Sketch plugins.

If you have any suggestions for plugin ideas then feel free to open an issue :)

### How do I install a plugin?

Simply drag and drop the .sublimeplugin file onto the Sketch app icon

### How do I use a plugin as a keyboard shortcut?

First install the plugin. Then in OS X navigate to Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts. In the left hand menu select "App Shortcuts", select "All Applications" in the right hand menu and click the plus icon. 

A new menu will appear allowing you to select Sketch as the Application, enter the name of the plugin under Menu Title, and finally the shortcut you'd like to use.
