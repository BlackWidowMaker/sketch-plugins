## Sketch Plugins

A random assortment of Sketch plugins.

I have heavily commented these plugins so that others can learn (and also to refresh
my memory on how to write JSTalk in x weeks/months/years time!)

If you have any suggestions for plugin ideas then feel free to open an issue :smiley:

Warning: **Always** save often when using any plugins. I have noticed that assigning a plugin to a
keyboard shortcut and spamming it is a great way to make Sketch crash. So be careful when using a plugin 
that you expect to use multiple times over a very short period of time (i.e. four times a second)

### How do I install a plugin?

You will need to place the library file "alessndro_library.js" in your Plugins directory first. All plugins
rely on the functions provided by it.

Double-click the .sublimeplugin file, or alternatively, drag and drop the file onto the Sketch app icon. This will automatically copy the plugin to your Sketch plugins folder.

### How do I use a plugin as a keyboard shortcut?

First install the plugin. Then in OS X navigate to Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts. In the left hand menu select "App Shortcuts", select "All Applications" in the right hand menu and click the plus icon. 

A new menu will appear allowing you to select Sketch as the Application, enter the name of the plugin under Menu Title, and finally the shortcut you'd like to use.
